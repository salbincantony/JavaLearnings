/**
 *
 * In a Multi threading environment, thread scheduler assigns processor to a
 * thread based on priority of thread. Whenever we create a thread in Java, it
 * always has some priority assigned to it. Priority can either be given by JVM
 * while creating the thread or it can be given by programmer explicitly.
 * Accepted value of priority for a thread is in range of 1 to 10. There are 3
 * static variables defined in Thread class for priority.
 * 
 * public static int MIN_PRIORITY: This is minimum priority that a thread can
 * have. Value for this is 1.
 * 
 * public static int NORM_PRIORITY: This is default priority of a thread if do
 * not explicitly define it. Value for this is 5.
 * 
 * public static int MAX_PRIORITY: This is maximum priority of a thread. Value
 * for this is 10.
 *
 *
 * What happens if there is more than one runnable thread with the same
 * (highest) priority? One of the highest priority threads gets picked. It is
 * completely up to the thread scheduler how to arbitrate between threads of the
 * same priority. The Java programming language gives no guarantee that all of
 * the threads get treated fairly. Of course, it would be desirable if all
 * threads of the same priority are served in turn, to guarantee that each of
 * them has a chance to make progress
