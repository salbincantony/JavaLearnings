 * @author Salbin StringBuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the
 *         object . The object created through StringBuffer is stored in the
 *         heap . StringBuffer has the same methods as the StringBuilder , but
 *         each method in StringBuffer is synchronized that is StringBuffer is
 *         thread safe . Due to this it does not allow two threads to
 *         simultaneously access the same method . Each method can be accessed
 *         by one thread at a time .
